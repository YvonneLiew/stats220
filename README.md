# stats220

## *This is my repo for 2023 S1 Stats 220.*

### This is what I'll be learning in this course:
1. How to use R to visualise data.
2. How to use Statistics to analyse data.

### I'm hoping to:
* Gain a deeper understanding of how programming and statistcs can help with data analysis.
* Learn more about the data analysis as a whole
